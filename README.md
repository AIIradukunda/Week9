Milestone3 
I was able to complete milestone3 and get the fingerprint and Ubuntu 14.04 welcome message
 
Milestone 4. I wasnâ€™t able to complete this one. The only thing that I was able to do was to install Dionaea.
This one failed 4 times and I had to stop it 

 



Milestone 5 says it should show 3 ports open for mine it is only showing one
